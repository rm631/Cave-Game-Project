# Cave-Game-Project

An old Unity project, primarily based around procedually generating a 2D cave environment for a character to traverse. The C# scripts for generating the environment were based on the tutorials found here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/procedural-cave-generation-tutorial. Animation and assets in large part can be found in these tutorials: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-roguelike-tutorial. Music assets were created by a friend of mine, Phil (https://www.youtube.com/user/PhilSkill96), specifically for use in this project; originally created as .midi files and then converted to .mp3 for use in Unity.

The purpose of this project was to learn about game design, specifically using Unity and developing my existing programming skills while learning some C#.
